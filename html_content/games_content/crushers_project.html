    <h5>Senior Game Developer | Contractor for Redemption Games Inc.</h5>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li><strong>Prototyped key gameplay features</strong>, including the <strong>Home panel tabs</strong>,
            <strong>Post Level Win/Lose sequence</strong>, and <strong>Trophy Road</strong>, helping shape core game
            mechanics.</li>
        <li>Developed shared libraries for core features such as UI management, assets retrieval, and object pooling,
            enabling code reuse across multiple projects and improving development efficiency.</li>
        <li>Implemented game configuration systems for features like Trophy Road and the main Core-Loop, ensuring
            seamless synchronization between backend and client. Used the same approach to define in-game items and
            store products, ensuring data integrity across all features.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a flexible, data-driven, and event-driven Tutorial System with live data updates
            for rapid debugging and iteration. The system, JSON-based for remote updates, supported custom actions such
            as navigating tabs, displaying custom assets, and triggering dialogues. It featured checkpoint and
            persistence mechanisms, allowing players to resume tutorials from saved progress and ensuring continuity
            even if they leave mid-tutorial.</li>
        <li>Developed a robust audio system with SFX variation, pitch/volume randomization, audio ducking, and dedicated
            buses for music and SFX. The system dynamically adapted to game and pause states using different AudioMixer
            presets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, <strong>prototyped</strong> initial versions of key gameplay features, including
        <strong>GoldRush</strong>, <strong>Season Pass</strong>, and <strong>Weekly Events</strong>, contributing to
        player engagement and monetization strategies.</p>
