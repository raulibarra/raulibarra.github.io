    <h1>Blood Brothers 2</h1>
    <h6>Tactical RPG game (Unity | C#)</h6>
    <h5>Senior Game Developer | DeNa Santiago</h5>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>Developed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W2vcIBGpc8"><strong>Fog of War</strong></a> system for the game that uses a custom shader to show/hide detected areas.</li>
        <li>Improved the logic of their 3v3 PVP matches by loading the next player team without having to go to a full size loading screen, 
            reducing PVP match loading times by ~50%. 
            This system was later used for their Raid Boss event, allowing player teams to load without leaving the combat screen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkCFUw2gOeY">raid boss battle system</a> that allowed multiple players to engage a single enemy. 
            This was a big feature where I worked with the server team, game designers and artists to create a fun and engaging experience for players.
            This system featured a multi-phase boss battle where the boss would change its abilities, appearance and animations as the players dealt damage to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Programmed an horizontal re-sequencing music system that changed the music depending on the phase of the battle, where the music would change seamlessly without any audio cut.
        </li>
    </ul>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">I also composed the music and designed sound effects for the Raid Boss.</p>
