    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li><strong>Developed and expanded a data-driven abilities system</strong> for towers and characters, integrating instant stat changes (e.g., healing), status effects (e.g., damage over time), and area-of-effect mechanics (e.g., healing fountains, lava zones), enriching gameplay and player interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimized Android game size by 35%</strong> using ETC compression for transparent textures. Developed a pipeline to split textures into RGB and Alpha channels and created shader variants to recombine them at runtime, reducing memory usage and improving performance on OpenGL 2.0 devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborated with artists</strong> to integrate VFX and animations, ensuring seamless synchronization between visual elements and game logic. Contributed to social features, including Facebook friend requests and energy-sharing.</li>
        <li><strong>Developed editor tools</strong> to streamline workflows, including a map editor, UI skinning system, and HotReload with real-time stats debugging for designers.</li>
        <li>Programmed an <strong>audio system</strong> with separate controls for music and SFX, prioritizing key audio events and implementing audio ducking, pre-dating Unity's audio mixer.</li>
