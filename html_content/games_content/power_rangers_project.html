    <h1>Power Rangers - Morphin Legends</h1>
    <h6>Turn Based RPG game developed (Unity | C#)</h6>
    <h5>Senior Game Developer | Globant</h5>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li><strong>Refactored the prototype abilities system</strong> to improve <strong>code reusability</strong> and ensure proper <strong>separation of responsibilities</strong> through well-structured classes.</li>
        <li>Enhanced the abilities system to be fully data-driven and made it unit testable. Developed numerous in-game abilities using this system, optimizing maintainability and scalability.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a data-driven, event-driven tutorial system, which listens to in-game events and dynamically triggers tutorials based on player actions (e.g., highlighting buttons), offering greater flexibility in tutorial activation and sequencing.&nbsp;It featured checkpoint and persistence mechanisms, allowing players to resume tutorials from saved progress and ensuring continuity even if they leave mid-tutorial</li>
        <li>Developed a custom impact SFX system that dynamically selects sound effects based on the attacker's weapon (e.g., sword, fists) and the opponent's material (e.g., flesh, rock), improving immersion and gameplay feedback.</li>
        <li>Composed and implemented original music, inspired by the style of 90â€™s TV show soundtracks, adding an authentic and nostalgic atmosphere to the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, <strong>developed key features</strong> like the <strong>heroes collection system</strong>, <strong>dialogue system</strong>, <strong>PVP system</strong>, and <strong>store system</strong>, contributing to core gameplay, multiplayer functionality, and monetization strategies.</p>
