    <h1>DC Legends</h1>
    <h6>Turn Based RPG game developed (Unity | C# | NodeJS)</h6>
    <h5>Senior FullStack Game Developer | Giant Monkey Robot</h5>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li><strong>Contributed to expanding a complex, data-driven ability system</strong>, implementing chained and
            conditional effects that impacted multiple characters from both teams. Enhanced the <strong>abilities editor
                tool</strong> to streamline the development process for designers.</li>
        <li><strong>Designed and developed a RaidBoss Battle system</strong>, enabling multiple players to engage a
            single enemy. This system featured dynamic scoring (e.g., MVP, First Encounter, Last Blow) and prize
            distribution. 
            <ul>
                <li>I implemented the data structures for seamless communication between the game client and
            backend. This collaborative event became a core feature
            throughout the gameâ€™s lifecycle</li>
                <li>Suggested and implemented "minions" feature for RaidBoss: These were characters that can be spawned at start or mid-battle 
                    and their porpuse is to protect the RaidBoss so it's harder to attack/kill it.</li>
                <li>Made a dynamic system to make some characters have increased stats on RaidBoss battles. For this we reused an existing 
                    system and updated character attributes realtime, to avoid having to create an entire system for this.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, <strong>developed key features</strong> like: <strong>event leaderboards</strong>, <strong>StepUp
            sales</strong>, and <strong>video ads integration</strong>, contributing to player engagement and
        monetization strategies.</p>
