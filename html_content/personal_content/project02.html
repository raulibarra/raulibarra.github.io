    <h3>Asteroids New Hope</h3>
    <h6>2D Asteroids game (Unity | C# | D.O.T.S.)</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Created mechanics for aiming, shooting, firing projectiles, destroying asteroids and spawning impact VFXs.</li>
        <li>Created logic to randomly spawn "upgrades" when destroying UFOs such as "increasing fire ratio" or "firing more bullets" at once.</li>
        <li>Added basic player stats system to keep track of lives left, enemies destroyed and equipped upgrades.</li>
        <li>Core audio manager to play music and trigger sfxs using Unity's builtin system (It uses a pool of AudioSources for better performance).</li>
        <li>Basic but effective pooling system for bullets based on Unity's Pooling classes.</li>
        <li>Created logic to move asteroids and bullets using D.O.T.S. system.</li>
        <li>Created a basic HUD system to display your score, remaining lives and stats when you lose (ie: asteroids/enemies destroyed).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, I composed the music and designed sound effects for the game.</p>
