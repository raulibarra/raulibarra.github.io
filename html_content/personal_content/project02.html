    <h3>Asteroids New Hope</h3>
    <h6>2D Asteroids game (Unity | C# | D.O.T.S.)</h6>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>Created mechanics for aiming, shooting, firing projectiles, destroying asteroids and spawning impact VFXs.</li>
        <li>Created logic to randomly spawn <strong>weapon upgrades</strong> when destroying UFOs, such as <strong>increase fire rate</strong> or <strong>fire more bullets at once</strong>.</li>
        <li>Added basic player stats system to keep track of lives left, enemies destroyed and upgrades equipped.</li>
        <li>Core audio manager to play music and trigger sfxs using Unity's built-in system (it uses a pool of audio sources for better performance).</li>
        <li>Simple but effective bullet pooling system based on Unity's pooling classes.</li>
        <li>Created logic to move asteroids and bullets using D.O.T.S. system.</li>
        <li>Created a basic HUD system to display your score, remaining lives and stats when you lose (i.e. asteroids/enemies destroyed).</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, I composed the music and designed sound effects for the game.</p>
