    <h3>Slippery Logs (Unity | C# | PlayFab | NodeJS)</h3>
    <h6>GaaS Infinite Jumper with remote LeaderBoards and cross-play (WebGL/Android)</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Core gameplay logic (jumping over logs, character energy, collectables and enemy)</li>
        <li>Added basic player stats system to keep track of your remaining energy and score.</li>
        <li>Integrated PlayFab to store player's data and retrieve LeaderBoards</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Used custom functions to increase player score based on remote parameters.</li>
            <li>While scores are simulated locally when jumping, they are calculated and retrieved by backend after X jumps to avoid cheating.</li>
            <li>All parameters are stored and retrieved from PlayFab</li>
            <li>Localization data is also retrieved from PlayFab.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Created a simple but effective pooling system for logs and collectables.</li>
        <li>Created system that spawns logs sections infinitely while advancing.</li>
        <li>Core audio manager to play music and trigger SFXs using Unity's builtin system (It uses a pool of AudioSources for better performance).</li>
        <li>Created and programmed all screens in the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also composed the music and designed the sound effects for the game.</p>
