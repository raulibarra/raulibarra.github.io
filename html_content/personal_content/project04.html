    <h3>Slippery Logs (Unity | C# | PlayFab | NodeJS)</h3>
    <h6>Infinite Jumper with remote settings, leaderboard and backend persistence</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Core gameplay logic (jumping over logs, character energy, collectables and enemies).</li>
        <li>Added basic player stats system to keep track of your remaining energy and score.</li>
        <li>Integrated PlayFab to store player data and retrieve leaderboards.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses custom functions to increase player score based on remote parameters.</li>
            <li>While scores are simulated locally during jumps, they are calculated and retrieved from the backend after X number of jumps to prevent cheating.</li>
            <li>All parameters are stored and retrieved from PlayFab</li>
            <li>Localization data is also retrieved from PlayFab.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Created a simple but effective pooling system for logs and collectables.</li>
        <li>Created a system that spawns log sections infinitely as you progress.</li>
        <li>Core audio manager for playing music and triggering SFXs using Unity's built-in system (it uses a pool of audio sources for better performance).</li>
        <li>Created and programmed all the game's screens.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also composed the music and designed the sound effects for the game.</p>
