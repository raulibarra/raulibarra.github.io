    <h3>Your Love as a Gift (Unity | C#)</h3>
    <h6>Concept 2D game that you can use to declare your love to your loved one.</h6>
    <p>The idea is that you can invite your partner to play this game. As soon as they reach the set number of points, a message appears, which you can customise.
        <br>The game will display a different sequence if the player chooses "Yes" or "No". Give it a try and see what happens!
        <br>Also, the music theme will change depending on the character you select as your partner (Try picking the Zombie one!).

    <ul>
        <li>Game Concept, Design and Development.</li>
        <li>Created a configurable game where you can customize the title, score to win, character sprites (you, your beloved one) and a winning message.</li>
        <li>Added basic player stats system to keep track of your remaining health and score.</li>
        <li>Core audio manager to play music and trigger SFXs using Unity's builtin system (It uses a pool of AudioSources for better performance).</li>
        <li>Created and programmed all screens in the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, I composed the music and designed sound effects for the game.</p>
