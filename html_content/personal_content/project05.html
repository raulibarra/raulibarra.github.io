    <h3>Your Love as a Gift (Unity | C#)</h3>
    <h6>Concept 2D game that you can use to declare your love to your loved one.</h6>
    <p>The idea is that you can invite your partner to play this game. As soon as they reach the number of points you set, a message appears that you can customize.
        <br>The game will display a different sequence if the player chooses "Yes" or "No". Give it a try and see what happens!
        <br>The music theme also changes depending on which character you choose as your partner (try picking the zombie!).

    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>Game concept, design and development.</li>
        <li>Created a configurable game where you can customize the title, points to win, character sprites (you, your loved one) and a winning message.</li>
        <li>Added a basic player stats system to keep track of your remaining health and score.</li>
        <li>Core audio manager to play music and trigger SFXs using Unity's built-in system (it uses a pool of audio sources for better performance).</li>
        <li>Created and programmed all the screens in the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I also composed the music and designed sound effects for the game.</p>
